# AIND-Pac-Man
Implement DFS, BFS, A* search for Pac-Man agent in different situations

Lab: Teaching Pac-Man to Search

In this lab, you will be using BFS, DFS, and A Star to teach Pac-Man to navigate his world in the most efficient way possible.

### Overview

You will teach Pac-Man to search his world to complete the following tasks:

1. find a single obstacle.
2. find multiple obstacles.
3. find the fastest way to eat all the food in the map.

This lab is possible thanks to the generous contributions of the UC Berkeley AI division and their work on the Pac-Man Project (http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/project_overview.html)
